## Content Strategy

### Critical Rule: Reddit Hates Self-Promotion

Reddit has a strong anti-self-promotion culture. The rule of thumb is **10:1** -- for every 1 self-promotional post, make 10 genuine community contributions. Violating this gets you downvoted, reported, or banned.

### How to Use Reddit

- **Primary use**: Community engagement, not broadcasting
- **Post to your profile** (u/wonderwomancode) for announcements/articles
- **Comment in subreddits** with genuine technical help
- **Share articles** to relevant subreddits only when they add clear value
- **Never** use the same title/text as other platforms -- Reddit readers can smell cross-posts

### Relevant Subreddits

| Subreddit | Use | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| r/webdev | Technical discussion, help | High engagement, strict rules |
| r/devops | Infrastructure discussion | Good for AF-relevant content |
| r/selfhosted | Decentralized/self-hosted projects | Natural AF audience |
| r/SideProject | Share what you're building | Accepts self-promotion on Saturdays |
| r/startups | Founder journey content | Good for build-in-public |
| r/WomenInTech | Community, mentorship | Supportive community |
| r/artificial | AI discussion | For AI agent content |
| r/cryptocurrency | DePIN/Web3 discussion | For DePIN content specifically |

### Posting Frequency
- Comments: 3-5x per week across subreddits (genuine help)
- Profile posts: 1-2x per month (articles, major updates)
- Subreddit posts: 1-2x per month (only truly valuable content)

### Tone
- Most authentic and least "brand-y" of all platforms
- Answer questions with genuine technical depth
- Never say "we" in a way that sounds corporate
- Self-deprecating humor plays well
- Admit what you don't know -- Reddit respects honesty
