Keep pinned: your best-performing thread OR a clear introduction to who you are and what you're building.

**Example pinned:**
```
Hi, I'm wonderwomancode.

I'm the CEO/CTO of @AlternateFutures - we're building decentralized cloud infrastructure that costs 40-60% less than AWS/Vercel.

I build in public, share the real story (debugging nightmares included), and believe infrastructure should be for everyone.

Follow along.
