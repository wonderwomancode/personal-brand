## About Section

```
Code is my superpower.

As CEO/CTO and Co-founder of Alternate Futures, I'm building the decentralized infrastructure platform that makes deploying on DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) as simple as clicking a button. Think "Vercel, but 40-60% cheaper and you actually own your infrastructure."

What I do:
- Architect and build cloud infrastructure on decentralized compute networks
- Lead a team shipping IPFS/Filecoin/Arweave hosting, serverless functions, and AI agent deployment
- Write about the intersection of AI, decentralized systems, and what it really takes to bootstrap a tech company

What I believe:
- The best infrastructure is the kind you don't think about
- Building in public makes everyone better
- Technical gatekeeping helps no one
- Every great thing starts with someone deciding to just build it

I share the real story here -- the wins, the debugging nightmares at 2am, the architecture decisions that kept me up at night, and the lessons I wish someone had told me earlier.
