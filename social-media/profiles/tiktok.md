## Content Strategy

### Content Types

| Format | Frequency | Length | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Quick tips** | 3-4x/week | 15-30s | "One thing I learned about [topic]" |
| **Day in the life** | 1x/week | 30-60s | Founder/CTO daily routine |
| **Code walkthroughs** | 1-2x/week | 30-60s | Screen recording with voiceover |
| **Storytime** | 1x/week | 60s | "The time I broke production..." |
| **Trending sounds** | As relevant | 15-30s | Tech twist on trending formats |

### Video Style
- Screen recordings with face cam in corner for code content
- Talking head for opinions and stories
- Pop-art brand colors as background/overlays
- Captions always on (most watch without sound)
- Hook in first 2 seconds -- or they scroll

### Hook Formulas
- "Here's something nobody tells you about [topic]..."
- "I lost $X because of this one mistake..."
- "Stop doing [common thing]. Do this instead."
- "POV: you're a CTO debugging production at 2am"
- "The difference between junior and senior developers is..."

### Hashtag Strategy
- `#wonderwomancode` (always)
- `#TechTok` `#CodingTikTok` `#LearnToCode`
- `#WomenInTech` `#FounderLife` `#StartupLife`
- `#WebDev` `#Programming` `#SoftwareEngineer`
- 3-5 trending/relevant hashtags per post

### TikTok-Specific Notes
- TikTok's API only supports video posting (no text-only)
- Cross-post strategy: Film once, post to TikTok + Reels + YouTube Shorts
- Vertical video only (9:16 ratio, 1080x1920)
- Use CapCut for editing (free, TikTok-integrated)
- Post during peak hours: 7-9am, 12-2pm, 7-9pm EST

### Automation Note
TikTok's Content Posting API requires app review and only handles video uploads. For now, post directly through the app. The automation scripts generate captions/hashtags that you can copy-paste when posting.
