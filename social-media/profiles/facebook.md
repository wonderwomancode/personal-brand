## Content Strategy

### Content Mix
- 30% Links to Medium articles and blog posts
- 25% Build in public updates (more narrative than other platforms)
- 20% Community engagement and group participation
- 15% Event promotion and recaps
- 10% Personal/behind-scenes

### Facebook-Specific Approach
- Longer-form narrative posts perform well
- Video content gets strong organic reach
- Facebook Groups are the real value -- find and contribute to:
  - Web development groups
  - Startup founder groups
  - Women in tech groups
  - Cloud computing / DevOps groups
  - Local tech community groups

### Posting Frequency
- 2-3x per week on page
- Active in 3-5 groups weekly
- Share Medium articles when published
- Go Live occasionally for Q&A or build sessions

### Facebook-Specific Rules
- More personal tone than LinkedIn
- Family/friends may see this -- keep it professional but warm
- Don't over-post (Facebook penalizes high frequency from pages)
- Boost important posts if budget allows ($5-10 for key announcements)
