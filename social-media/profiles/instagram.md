## Content Strategy

### Content Types
- **Carousels** (primary): Technical tips, lessons learned, architecture decisions (swipeable educational content)
- **Reels**: Quick coding tips, day-in-the-life, conference clips
- **Stories**: Behind-the-scenes, polls, Q&A, real-time updates
- **Feed posts**: Milestone graphics, quote cards, team photos

### Visual Style for Feed
- Consistent pop-art filter/treatment on photos
- Brand color overlays on images
- Halftone dot texture as decorative element
- Ben-Day dot backgrounds on quote cards
- Consistent font usage (Instrument Sans) on all graphics
- Color palette stays within brand (magenta, cyan, yellow, black, cream)

### Grid Aesthetic
Aim for a cohesive grid where every 3rd post uses a different format:
1. Carousel (educational)
2. Quote/text graphic
3. Photo/behind-scenes with brand treatment

### Carousel Templates

**Technical Lesson (10 slides):**
1. Hook slide (bold title, brand gradient background)
2. The problem
3-7. The steps/explanation
8. The result
9. Key takeaway
10. CTA: Follow for more / Link in bio

**Build in Public Update (5-7 slides):**
1. "This week at @AlternateFutures" header
2-5. What shipped, what broke, what we learned
6. What's next
7. CTA

### Posting Frequency
- Feed: 3-5x per week
- Stories: Daily (even if just a reshare or poll)
- Reels: 1-2x per week

### Hashtag Strategy for Instagram
Use 5-10 per post (in first comment, not caption):
```
