## Voice Across Contexts

### Announcing Something

**Do**: "We just shipped custom domains on Alternate Clouds. Took us 6 weeks, 3 architecture pivots, and one all-nighter I'm still recovering from. Here's what we learned."

**Don't**: "HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT! We're thrilled to share our AMAZING new feature!!!"

### Sharing Technical Content

**Do**: "The trick to IPFS pinning at scale isn't the pinning -- it's the unpinning strategy. Here's our approach and why we changed it twice."

**Don't**: "10 MIND-BLOWING tips for IPFS that will CHANGE YOUR LIFE"

### Responding to Criticism

**Do**: "Fair point. Our cold starts are slower than Vercel's -- that's a real tradeoff. Here's our roadmap for improving it and why we think the cost savings still make it worth exploring."

**Don't**: "Actually, if you understood decentralized infrastructure, you'd know why that's wrong."

### Celebrating Community

**Do**: "Shoutout to @developer who just deployed their first AI agent on Alternate Clouds. The deploy logs had a few plot twists, but they stuck with it. That's the energy."

**Don't**: "Another happy customer! Thanks for choosing us!"

### Personal/Whimsical

**Do**: "Debugging a production issue at 2am and my cat just knocked my coffee onto my keyboard. If this isn't the developer experience everyone talks about, I don't know what is."

**Don't**: "OMG I'm so random lol, coding with my cat again!"

### Check Before Posting
- Anything that could be seen as AF's official position (clarify it's personal)

- Content that references AF customers or partners by name

### Never

## The Whimsy Factor

The "wonderwomancode" handle invites playfulness. Here's how to deploy it:

**Superhero metaphors** (use 1-2x per week, not every post):
- "My superpower? Turning 'it works on my machine' into 'it works on every machine.'"
- "Every great origin story starts with a problem nobody else wants to solve."
- "Even Wonder Woman had a team. Building alone is overrated."

**Comic book references** (when they fit naturally):
- Comparing debugging to detective work
- Comparing deploy days to battle scenes
- "With great infrastructure comes great responsibility"

**Pop culture** (broad references, not niche):
- Movie/TV references that most tech people would get
- Gaming references (widely known ones)
- Meme formats (adapt, don't just repost)

**The rule**: If the whimsy enhances the technical point, include it. If it distracts from it, cut it.
