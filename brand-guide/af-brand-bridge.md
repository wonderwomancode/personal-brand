## When to Use Which Brand

### Use Personal Brand When:
- Sharing personal opinions on tech/industry
- Building in public content (even about AF)
- Engaging in community discussions
- Writing thought leadership on LinkedIn/Medium
- Responding as yourself in conversations
- Speaking at conferences (bio uses personal brand, slides can use AF)

### Use AF Brand When:
- Official product announcements
- Company blog posts
- Documentation and tutorials on AF products
- Customer-facing communications
- Investor-facing materials
- Job postings and recruiting

### Bridge Content (Both):
- "Here's what I learned building @AlternateFutures" -> Personal voice, tag AF
- Conference talks about AF technology -> Personal brand + AF slides
- Podcasts -> Introduce as wonderwomancode, discuss AF naturally
- Twitter/X threads about AF features -> Personal account, tag @AlternateFutures

---

## Visual Bridge Rules

### Headers and Graphics
- Personal headers use the CMYK/pop-art palette
- When AF is mentioned in personal content, the Electric Blue `#3D5AFE` acts as bridge
- Never use the AF Brand Blue `#000AFF` as a primary color on personal brand materials
- AF logo can appear in personal content as a "built by" or "founder of" attribution, not as the dominant visual

### Co-Branded Situations
- Conference speaker cards: Personal avatar + name, AF logo small in corner
- Podcast graphics: Personal avatar, "CEO/CTO @AlternateFutures" in text
- Guest blog posts: Personal avatar, AF mentioned in bio

### Example Bio Patterns

**Short (X/Twitter, Bluesky, Farcaster):**
```
CEO/CTO @AlternateFutures | Building decentralized infra for the rest of us | Code is my superpower
```

**Medium (LinkedIn, Medium):**
```
CEO/CTO and Co-founder of Alternate Futures, where we're making decentralized infrastructure as easy as Vercel. Previously [background]. I build in public, write about infrastructure and AI, and believe the best code is the code that empowers others.
```

**Long (About pages, speaker bios):**
```
As CEO/CTO and Co-founder of Alternate Futures, I'm building the decentralized infrastructure platform that makes deploying on DePIN as simple as clicking a button. Our mission: cut cloud costs 40-60% while giving developers true ownership of their infrastructure.

I code, I lead, and I believe in building in public -- sharing the wins, the debugging nightmares, and everything in between. When I'm not shipping features or reviewing PRs, you can find me writing about the intersection of AI, decentralized systems, and what it really takes to bootstrap a tech company.

The handle? A friend made me a pop-art avatar years ago and it stuck. Turns out "code is my superpower" isn't just a tagline -- it's the daily reality of a technical founder.

## Content Tagging Rules

When posting about AF from personal accounts:
1. Always tag `@AlternateFutures` (or platform equivalent)
2. Use `#AlternateFutures` hashtag
3. Frame as personal perspective: "What I learned..." / "Why we decided..."
4. Don't use official announcement language from a personal account
5. Be more candid than the company account would be -- that's the value of personal brand

When AF company accounts reference the founder:
1. Tag `@wonderwomancode`
2. "Our CEO/CTO @wonderwomancode" (never just first name in official content)
3. Can share/repost personal content that aligns with AF brand voice
