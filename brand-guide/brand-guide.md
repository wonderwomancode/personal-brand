## Visual Identity

### The Avatar

The signature avatar is a **CMYK halftone pop-art portrait** - a direct homage to Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol's comic-book aesthetic. This is the visual cornerstone of the brand.

**Key characteristics:**
- Halftone dot pattern in magenta, cyan, yellow, and black
- Comic book / pop art feel
- Retro printing technique rendered digitally
- Immediately recognizable at any size

**Usage rules:**
- Use the halftone avatar as the primary profile picture on ALL platforms
- Never crop it below the shoulders - the composition matters
- On dark backgrounds, add a 2px white border or slight white glow
- The avatar should always be circular where platforms allow

### Color Palette

The personal palette is derived from the CMYK halftone avatar colors, with a bridge to the Alternate Futures brand blue.

```

### Visual Elements

#### Halftone Dots
The halftone dot pattern from the avatar can be used as a decorative element:
- Background textures on headers
- Section dividers
- Overlay on photos for brand consistency
- CSS: `radial-gradient(circle, #E91E63 1px, transparent 1px)` with appropriate sizing

#### Star Accents
Borrowed from the AF design system but in personal brand colors:
- Small decorative stars in Hot Magenta or Golden Yellow
- Use sparingly - 2-3 per composition maximum
- Adds the whimsy factor

#### Comic Book Elements
- Speech bubbles for quotes or callouts
- "POW!" / "ZAP!" style burst shapes for announcements (sparingly)
- Ben-Day dot patterns as backgrounds
- Bold outlines (2-3px) on key elements

## Voice and Tone

See `voice-and-tone.md` for the complete guide.

**Quick reference:**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Technical depth | Real engineering insight, not surface-level takes |
| Warm approachability | Like explaining to a friend, not lecturing |
| Comic-book whimsy | Pop culture references, superhero metaphors (tasteful) |
| Empowering | "You can do this" energy, not gatekeeping |
| Honest | Shares failures alongside wins |
| Bootstrapped pride | Celebrates resourcefulness |

**Voice examples:**

Good: "Just shipped a feature that took 3 weeks of debugging. The fix? A missing semicolon. The lesson? Humility is free and always in stock."

Good: "Hot take: the best infrastructure is the one you don't think about. That's what we're building at @AlternateFutures."

Bad: "So excited to announce!!! We're the BEST platform ever!!!" (hyperbole, generic)

Bad: "Only real developers understand this." (gatekeeping)

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Share genuine technical insights
- Credit others' work generously
- Use humor and pop culture references naturally
- Show the messy parts of building (failed deploys, bugs, pivots)
- Bridge personal content to AF naturally (not forced)
- Respond to community members
- Use the halftone aesthetic in graphics

### Don't
- Use generic corporate-speak
- Gatekeep technical knowledge
- Trash competitors (AF policy applies personally too)
- Over-use superhero references to the point of cringe
- Post without checking tone against brand voice
- Use the AF logo as personal brand (they're separate)
- Cross-post identical content without platform adaptation
